#### How to find a job&#x20;

Phase 1 - Preparation \
\- Don't be generic, be specialist \
\- Identify who you are in the market or who you wanna be - do your Personal Brand\
\- Identify the position names (IT Support Engineer, ICT Help Desk, Tech Support) \
\- Create a list of skills required \
\- Add missing skills on your Linkedin and CV.\
\- Learn the skills you don't know\


Phase 2 - Job Applications\
\- a few  -> you can lose opportunities\
\- a lot -> you will feel said because you have received so many NO. \
\- For the right one -> You will pass a lot of interviews and you will choose the job you want to work.&#x20;

\
&#x20;Phase 3 - Interview\
\- Prepare yourself for the interview (google and youtube) - Soft and Hard Skills\
\- Be straight to the point - speaking a lot doesn't mean you are good \
\- Do you wanna work as a permanent or contractor? \
\- How much do you want to earn?\
\- Don't give up if the recruiter says your visa is a problem, your English is a problem, your experience. Maybe you are not good for that position or company. \
\- Nothing is important if the company wants to hire you (Visa, English, Experience).&#x20;

&#x20;Phase 4 (Optional)\
\- Once you get a job - don't leave IT.BR - help the community \
