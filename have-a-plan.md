#### Replying after interview

Hi XXXX,

Thank you for making my interview on Tuesday so pleasant. I loved getting to hear about how CSR's typical workday looks like and was especially impressed by your excitement in sharing your experience at the company. Your happiness was contagious!

My enthusiasm for the position and working for Elastic is only growing. I would be thrilled to meet you again as a colleague.

In addition, I'm confident that I would be a great fit for this position because of my customer support experience. Having worked for multiple companies in different roles there has always been one thing that remains consistent, my satisfaction in helping people solve problems.

I also enjoyed knowing we have similar hobbies like running and cooking. It was nice to know you like being around the kitchen and trying new recipes :)

Thank you again for taking the time to talk with me, and I look forward to hearing back from the recruitment team.

Have a good day!

Warm Regards, Anderson\


#### Replying Negative Answer&#x20;

Thanks for letting me know about your decision.

While I’ll admit that It’s not good to know I won’t be able to go further in the process, I really appreciate the time you spent speaking with me about the position, your company’s climate and history, and the wonderful opportunities available within your organization.

Your professionalism and attention in every message on LinkedIn, phone calls and emails made me feel a special candidate. There's no better feeling for someone that is trying to get back into the market after a gap, especially in another country. You’re doing a great job and I’m super grateful for have had this experience conducted by you.

Certainly, the final candidate will admire this company as much as I do.

I hope that you'll keep me in mind for future opportunities, as I know Mimecast is growing. Meanwhile, I'll keep improving my skills.

I'd love the chance to have our paths crossed again. Let’s keep in touch, for sure.

I’m wishing you and Mimecast all the best moving forward.

Thank you for your time and encouragement.

Sincerely, Marcio Amaral



#### Negociating Salary

Hi Marcio,

Thanks for your response, glad to see you might be interested!

Salary wise we are open to negotiation, depending on level of experience. May I know what you would be expecting and I can let you know if that would be within our scope?

Very happy to chat further with you if all aligns!

Thanks, Sam&#x20;



Hi Samatha,

Many thanks for getting back to me.

My expectations are flexible and I’m happy to discuss them, but my top priority is making sure this is the right fit for both of us.

Also, I completely understand that you can’t move forward without a figure, that’s fair.

Would you be open to sharing the range you have budgeted for this role? That way we can make sure we’re aligned.

Thanks, Marcio
